\section*{Most FAQs by First-time Users}
\question{What is Dolphin Design Intelligence?}
\answer{Dolphin is your all-in-one platform for documents and design needs. It instantly generates a variety of document formats including letters, reports, proposals, presentations, certificates, invoices, infographics, and many more types---directly from your data. Instead of juggling Word, PPT, PDF, and other design tools, Dolphin gives you a unified workspace with consistent, highest-resolution print-ready, professional outputs while keeping the file sizes at their lowest.}

\question{How does Dolphin serve as a one-stop shop for my design and documentation?}
\answer{Teams usually spend hours formatting in Word, designing in PowerPoint, or exporting to PDF. Dolphin eliminates this complexity. Using data-driven smart templates, it automates repetitive tasks and instantly creates high-quality outputs---saving time, ensuring brand consistency, and delivering faster results.}

\question{Is it easy to use?}
\answer{Yes. If your team can use Word or Excel, they can use Dolphin. The learning curve is minimal, and we provide onboarding support and training to get you started quickly.}

\question{How fast is it?}
\answer{Instant. Whether it's 10 or 10,000 documents, Dolphin generates outputs in seconds once the template and data are ready.}

\question{How much does it cost?}
\answer{Pricing depends on your team size and usage. We offer both subscription-based and perpetual license options, with flexibility for different organizations.}

\question{Is Dolphin cloud-based or on-premises?}

\question{My employees are accustomed to Word, PPT, and PDF. Why should we learn Dolphin?}
\answer{Dolphin directly addresses the biggest pain points these tools can't solve---like manual formatting and repetitive document tasks. Instead of spending hours, you simply supply your data, pick a template, and Dolphin instantly generates professional, high-quality documents. The learning curve is minimal, and productivity gains are significant.}

\question{Will Dolphin add to the long list of tools we already use?}
